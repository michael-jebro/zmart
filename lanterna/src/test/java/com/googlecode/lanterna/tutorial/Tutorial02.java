            Most terminals and terminal emulators supports what's known as "private mode" which is a separate buffer for
            the text content that does not support any scrolling. This is frequently used by text editors such as nano
            and vi in order to give a "fullscreen" view. When exiting from private mode, the previous content is usually
            restored, including the scrollback history. Emulators that don't support this properly might at least clear
            the screen after exiting.

            You can use the enterPrivateMode() to activate private mode, but you'll need to remember to also exit
            private mode afterwards so that you don't leave the terminal in a weird state when the application exists.
            The usual close() at the end will do this automatically, but you can also manually call exitPrivateMode()
            and finally Lanterna will register a shutdown hook that tries to restore the terminal (including exiting
            private mode, if necessary) as well.
             */

            /*
            The terminal content should already be cleared after switching to private mode, but in case it's not, the
            clear method should make all content set to default background color with no characters and the input cursor
            in the top-left corner.

            all implementations supports this. The UnixTerminal, for example, relies on the WINCH signal being sent to
